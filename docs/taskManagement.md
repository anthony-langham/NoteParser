## Task Guidelines

- Before commencing a new task ensure you think really hard about the optimal solution before starting
- Each task should be completable in a single Claude Code session
- Tasks must be atomic and focused on one specific deliverable
- Use task IDs (#001, #002, etc.) in all git commits
- Test locally before committing
- Each task should include appropriate documentation
- **Environment Setup**: Always use `nvm use` before starting work
- **Security**: Never commit .env files or sensitive data
- **Dependencies**: Use exact Node version specified in .nvmrc
- **Status Updates**: Update task status in CLAUDE.md when starting/completing tasks

### Task Status Management

1. **Starting a task**: Change status from [TODO] to [INPROG]
2. **Completing a task**: Change status from [INPROG] to [DONE]
3. **Blocking issues**: Change status to [BLOCKED] with reason
4. **Git commits**: Always include task ID and status (e.g., "#001 [DONE] Setup project structure")
5. **Commit ALL files**: **MANDATORY** - At the end of each task, commit ALL changes across ALL files in the ENTIRE repository using `git add .` before committing
6. **Git push**: **MANDATORY** - After every commit, ALWAYS ask user for permission to push to GitHub before proceeding

### Example Task Status Flow

```
#001 [TODO] â†’ #001 [INPROG] â†’ #001 [DONE]
```
